Landmark files used to create DSM2 output locations.

The "landmark" folder contains
 - two excel files, om_compliance_stations.xlsx and output_loc_files.xlsx. These files are used to create the CSDP landmark files (.cdl) in the landmark folder.
 - The files output_mid_r_flow.cdl and output_sal_ec.cdl contain modified station coordinates, and are used to create output locations for comparison with
   - flow data from station MDM, because in DSM2, this location is represented by two roughly parallel channels rather than one.
   - EC data from station SAL, on the SJR. At this location, observed EC is influenced primaraly by the Mokelumne River EC, however, DSM2 does not simulate
     EC accurately at this location. For the purposes of creating a DSM2 output location, the station coordinates are moved to a location in the Mokelumne
     River near the SJR. Stations MDM and SAL should not appear in any other landmark or output*.inp files to avoid mistakes.

Procedure:
Use the excel files to export the station coordinate data to landmark files.
Use notepad++ to copy the landmark metadata lines to the files you created. Update NumElements to match the number of stations in the file.
Use the CSDP to create the output location files (.inp, see CSDP documentation).


Notes:
* for flow at station MDM, there is a separate landmark file, which should be used to create a separate output location file. This is because the two flow outputs need to be subtracted to compare with observed.
* The landmark files were created using the excel file output_loc_files, which assigns coordinates to station abbreviations. The sources for the landmark files are stations_utm_new.csv (from Bay-Delta SCHISM repository) and stations_dbase (from Sophie/MSS), and stations_other, where I have mapped RKI values to cdec style abbreviations, and determined coordinates for a few other stations (including MDM1 and MDM2, which I am using to create the two outputs for this station) using CDEC and on online coordinate conversion tool.
* Coordinates for the following stations are modified in output_loc_files.xlsx:
  * HLT, because the actual location is in a portion of the grid represented by a complex network of channels, and the flow at this location is better represented by channel 159.
  * SAL, because although the station location is in the San Joaquin River, 
* If you need to update the coordinates in the excel file, remember to comment out and modify coordinates for stations HLT and SAL.
* output location files for O&M compliance locations are created separately, using om_compliance_stations.xlsx.
